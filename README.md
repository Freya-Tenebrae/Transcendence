# Transcendence

This Repositorie contains my solution to the project `Transcendence` of 42 (Paris).

It was made with [Maximilien Mercorelli](https://github.com/mmercore), [Pierre Marie Lam](https://github.com/Askeladd42), and [Walid Ben Farhat](https://github.com/walidbenf)

## Description

This project aims to create a website hosting a pong game, with auth systems, live chat, and multiplayer.

## Using Cub3D

### Cloning

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Freya-Tenebrae/Transcendence.git
```

### Cub3D

On Cub3dD there is no door, no entities, no pickup, no end, no action possible (exept movement) and textures are defined by wall orientation

#### Compilation

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

#### launch

after the compilation you can access to the website with the address `https://127.0.0.1:2002/`
